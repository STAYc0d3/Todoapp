# Todoapp â€“ Django Task Management Application

## Introduction:
This is my first pet project that I'm publishing on GitHub. **Todoapp** is a task management application built using Django, allowing users to create, edit, and manage tasks efficiently. This project demonstrates my understanding of web development technologies and my ability to integrate various tools and frameworks.

## Features:
- Task creation, editing, and deletion.
- Validation and handling of task forms.
- SQLite as the database for task storage.

## Technologies Used:
- **Django**: Used for backend logic, request handling, and database management.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing and structuring the user interface.
- **Django Forms**: Implemented to handle task creation and modification with built-in validation.
- **SQLite**: As a lightweight database for managing task records.
- **Django Templating System**: For rendering dynamic content and building user-friendly views.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and project collaboration.
- **ChatGPT Assistance**: Used for generating parts of the HTML, CSS, and troubleshooting issues, significantly speeding up development.
